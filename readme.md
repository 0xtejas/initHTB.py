This script helps us to add IP, host name entry in hosts file and create directory run nmap scan and directory scan with your favourite tools. 
More commands will be available, as you create issue.

# SETTING UP

1. You'll have to run this if you are not a root user `sudo chown $USER /etc/hosts`.
2. There is a template `hosts` file along with this, **please maintain the structure**.
